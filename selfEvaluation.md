# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?

I will need to do additional practice on for statements. I feel okay about it presently.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

I branched out and searched for more information with google, it was difficult but felt good in the end. I did have areas of productive struggle where I was able to push through it. I did also have unproductive struggle where I needed to walk away and eat to level out.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I will need to practice more for/if relationships. I will practice over time. I currently do not need to adjust.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

I will still have questions regarding some syntax with for statements. I have been using my peers and instructer when necessary.
